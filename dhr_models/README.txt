Two computational models are provided for each design. The models with the suffix _AF.pdb are AlphaFold predictions. The models with the suffix _ideal.pdb are the low energy idealized flat and repetitive models (see Supplementary Fig. 3) generated as described in the methods. Idealized models with different spacings may be found with Rosetta protocols used to generate them may be found in DHR_CaCO3/methods/idealizing_dhr_models/

DHR49_neg models are based on the parent scaffold DHR49 (pdb id: 5CWJ)
